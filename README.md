# Fern's Fancy inventory
FFI is a dark mode GUI pack using much darker tones than typical packs usually would, getting a more OLED look. With plenty of modded support already, with more on the way, to save your eyes regardless of what fun modpack you'll be playing. Whenever the mod allows for it, there is also an attempt at making the GUI reflect the block/container itself.
