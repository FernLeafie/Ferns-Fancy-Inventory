# To Do
### General maintenance
Issues with standardisation and general maintenance of the pack
- Finish the style guide, and clearly define all the colours for different components and their shape and style, this includes inventory shape, colours, stuff like the stonecutter selection buttons, scroll bars, and whatever else comes to be needed. Preferably including text descriptions of usage.
- Decide on one and standardise the scrollbar to one of the variants shown in the iconography guide.
- Standardise the buttons to have the highlighted version be slightly lighter than the unhighlighted one, as shown in the iconography guide.
- âœ“ Make a new version of the hotbar numbering that only uses one colour instead of the many ones in the current one. 
  - Then update all GUIs to use it.
