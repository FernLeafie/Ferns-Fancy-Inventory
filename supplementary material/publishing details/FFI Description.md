# Fern's Fancy inventory
FFI is a dark mode GUI pack using much darker tones than typical packs usually would, getting a more OLED look. With plenty of modded support already, with more on the way, to save your eyes regardless of what fun modpack you'll be playing. Whenever the mod allows for it, there is also an attempt at making the GUI reflect the block/container itself.

## Recommended Mods
So far this pack works best if you use either Optifine or [OptiGUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/optigui) since the vanilla inventories storage inventories rely on them.

Another useful mod is [GUI Pack Utils](https://modrinth.com/mod/gui-pack-utils) by [Szedann](https://modrinth.com/user/Szedann), that allows to make all the modded inventory tab titles a white to fit with the style of the pack.

<summary>List and support</summary>

| ❌ - Not supported | ✅ - Supported | ⚠️ - Partial support |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|

Partial support could mean that all inventories in the mod are dark, but not styled, or that some are styled and some aren't, or some remain light, or that it simply lacks support to remove the title of a GUI.

1.21 currently includes all the mod files from 1.20, but the mods are yet to update, so unless they change their files when updating, FFI should work when they get a 1.21 version.

1.20 and 1.21 legacy versions are to support create 0.5.1 and below, until not required anymore.
